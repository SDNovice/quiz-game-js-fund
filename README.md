# quiz-game-js-fund

## Description
The purpose of this site was in order to help fellow classmates test their
javascript knowledge. They would have an highscore relating to the time left (the
time being removed for each wrong question). I however ran into an issue with my event
listners. Through tutoring sessions, office hours with TAs and even discusing it with
peers my code has been alterted extensively. My options for my quiz (while they are
dispayed via a for loop) can't seem to be target by an event listner. I was able to 
get from my start screen to the first question and set up the timer but thats all i got
through. I was up late trying to solvet this but eventually passed out so please bear with me

## Usage
click the start button to be sent to the first question prompt and a timer will be displayed.
Everytime a question is anser a prompt will state if its wrong or correct and for each wrong 
question 15 secs will be removed. Each Highscores will be displayed by time remaining
so please record your initals at the end of the game!
